# Programming and Scripting Project 2019

This project will look at Ronald Fisher and his Iris data set.  It will investigate the data set and get the ?????



##Introduction
*"R.A. Fisher was born in London on 17 February 1890, the son of a fine-art auctioneer. His twin brother was stillborn. At Harrow School he distinguished himself in mathematics, despite being handicapped by poor eyesight which prevented him working by artificial light. His teachers used to instruct by ear, and Fisher developed a remarkable capacity for pursuing complex mathematical arguments in his head. This manifested itself in later life in his ability to reach a conclusion whilst forgetting the argument; to handle complex geometrical trains of thought; and to develop and report essentially mathematical arguments in English (only for students to have to reconstruct the mathematics later)."*

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The data set contains 150 observation of the Iris flowers. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.  The first four colums are numerical with one decimal place and a text column with the flower name.

Sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the
morphologic variation of Iris ﬂowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the
Gasp´e Peninsula ”all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by
the same person with the same apparatus”.
The three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) are separable by the unsupervising
procedures of non-linear principal component analysis. To discriminate them, it is suﬃcient just to select the
corresponding nodes on the principal tree.
